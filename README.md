# Introduction_to_data_visualization_example

In this training, we will explore data visualization using Python's Matplotlib package. We will learn how to implement various plotting techniques, distinguish between graph types, and choose the best visual representation for data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you should be able to:

- Implement various plotting techniques using Python's Matplotlib package.
- Distinguish between different types of graphs.
- Understand how to best represent data using a specific graph.
- Analyze and draw insights from graphs.

## Introduction

Data visualization is the process of presenting data and information in graphical forms such as charts, maps, and diagrams. The goal of these graphics is to improve understanding of the underlying data by making patterns, trends, correlations, and outliers more visible than a simple study of the raw data.

There may be numerous occasions when we will need to share our data-driven results and insights. Unfortunately, raw data is not always appropriate for this purpose. This is where maximizing the potential of data visualization becomes critical. In this training, we will learn how to visualize data using Python's graphing library, Matplotlib, as well as how to identify the appropriate visualization approaches to apply based on the data we are given.

There are many different ways to represent the same data, and the choice of visualization affects what information is conveyed to the audience. In this training, we'll review some of the most basic (yet useful and reliable) chart options.

Below is an image depicting some of the most popular charts used for data visualization:
